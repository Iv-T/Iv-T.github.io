I am a 1st year Ph.D. student in [GrUVi Lab]() at [Simon Fraser University](https://www.sfu.ca/), co-supervised by Prof. [Manolis Savva](https://msavva.github.io/) and Prof. [Arash (Ali) Mahdavi-Amiri](https://www.sfu.ca/~amahdavi/).
I am broadly interested in computer vision and graphics in deep learning, with specialty in neural rendering, shape analysis and generative content. 
My research currently focus on 3D understanding and generation of interactable objects.

I received my M.Sc. degree in computer science from [University of Southern California](https://www.usc.edu/), and worked as a research assistant (2020-2022) in [Vision and Graphics Lab](https://vgl.ict.usc.edu/) at [USC Institute for Creative Technology](https://ict.usc.edu/). I got my B.Eng. degree in software engineering at [Sichuan University](https://en.scu.edu.cn/) with distinction.
