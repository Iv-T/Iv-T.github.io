I am a Ph.D. candidate at [Simon Fraser University](https://www.sfu.ca/) in [GrUVi](https://gruvi.cs.sfu.ca//) & [3dlg](https://3dlg-hcvc.github.io/) lab. I am honored to be co-supervised by Prof. [Arash (Ali) Mahdavi-Amiri](https://www.sfu.ca/~amahdavi/) and Prof. [Manolis Savva](https://msavva.github.io/). 
I am broadly interested in the understanding, reconstruction, and creation of 3D content, with specialty in neural rendering, shape analysis and generative content. 
My research currently focus on 3D understanding and generation of interactable objects.

I received my M.Sc. degree in computer science from [University of Southern California](https://www.usc.edu/), and worked as a research assistant (2020-2022) in [Vision and Graphics Lab](https://vgl.ict.usc.edu/) at [USC Institute for Creative Technology](https://ict.usc.edu/). I got my B.Eng. degree in software engineering at [Sichuan University](https://en.scu.edu.cn/) with distinction.
