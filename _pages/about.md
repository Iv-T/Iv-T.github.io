I am a M.Sc. student at [Simon Fraser University](https://www.sfu.ca/) in [GrUVi](https://gruvi.cs.sfu.ca//) & [3dlg](https://3dlg-hcvc.github.io/) lab.
I am honored to be supervised by Prof. [Manolis Savva](https://msavva.github.io/).
I am broadly interested in computer graphics, and my current research focuses on 3D scene generation.

I received my B.Sc. degree in computer science from SFU in 2023 with first class distinction and was awarded the [Governor General's Silver Medal](https://www.gg.ca/en/honours/recipients/116-113453) for outstanding academic achievement.
